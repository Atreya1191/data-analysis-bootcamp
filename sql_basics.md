# What is SQL?

- SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**, and was designed in 1974 to manage data in Relational Database Systems. We'll explain the **Relational database model** in next class.
- The word **database** denotes a collection of data, organized using some structure.
- SQL, first of all, is a _language_, i.e., it is used to communicate your intent with the computer system.
- The intent is to _manage_ the data. SQL can be used to _add_ new data, _modify_ existing data, and most importantly for analysts, _read_ already stored data.
- Code written in SQL is a collection of **queries**.
- The database _system_ is the interpreter for this language - it's like a butler who understands your query and executes your wishes.
- In 1986/1987, the specification of the language was standardized. Which means, the language words are not proprietary to one database developer, and everyone abides (mostly) by this one standard of SQL.

## SQL vs Data System

One thing that I want to highlight is the separation of SQL with the underlying system that stores the data. Shown below is a stock image of an "accountant".

- The paper containing numbers represents the data system.
- The person represents the SQL coder.
- The calculator represents the SQL execution engine.
- If you replace the paper with some other notebook or the model of the calculator, the person will still be able to get through their analysis.

- SQL written according to international standards will work with all database systems.
- Not only that, new models of data storage (especially big data models) are also using SQL as the interface between the analyst and their data.
